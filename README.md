- The application focuses on the front-end aspects.
- The application is developed in normal vanila javascript and no framework has been used because I think to acheive the objectives of this application is easily achievable with plain vanilla javascript.
- This application is hosted in azure web app service. The hosted version of this application can be found in this link http://foodtruck.azurewebsites.net/
